        "  - Cirrhosis is a late stage of liver scarring (fibrosis) brought on by a variety of liver disorders and conditions, including prolonged alcoholism and hepatitis. The information gathered during the 1974-1984 Mayo Clinic trial on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver is presented here. 424 PBC patients who were referred to Mayo Clinic during the course of that ten-year period qualified for the drug D-penicillamine's randomized placebo-controlled trial. The dataset's initial 312 cases, which took part in the randomized study, include mostly complete data. Although the extra 112 individuals declined to take part in the clinical experiment, they agreed to have some basic measurements taken and to be monitored for survival. The data presented here include 312 randomized individuals as well as an extra 106 cases because six of those cases were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis.\n",
